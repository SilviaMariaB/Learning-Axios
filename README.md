# Learning-Axios
// Step 1: Make sure that when a user visits the home page, it shows a random activity.You will need to check the format of the JSON data from response.data and edit the index.ejs file accordingly.
// https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/filter?type=req.body.type&participants=req.body.participants 
// Step 2: Play around with the drop downs and see what gets logged.
// Use axios to make an API request to the /filter endpoint. Making sure you're passing both the type and participants queries.  
// Render the index.ejs file with a single *random* activity that comes back from the API request.
// Step 3: If you get a 404 error (resource not found) from the API request. Pass an error to the index.ejs to tell the user: "No activities that match your criteria."
